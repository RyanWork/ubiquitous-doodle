# ubiquitous-doodle
My personal website and some stuff about me.

## Who Am I
My name is Ryan. I am a software developer who is ambitious in taking on new challenges and providing thorough and quality in my code. I pride myself in being able to deliver quality through adhering to best practices, providing thorough testing, and making code as clean and elegant as possible! Writing clean code is something I actually find a lot of pleasure in doing (oddly enough). I'm also really interested in the domain of software security. I find application security to be really interesting. I hope to pursue a bigger hobby in white hatting.

Working aside and knowing a little bit more about me at a personal level, I am a huge gamer! Winding down with same games is something I love to do after a long days of work. I'm personally playing a lot of FFXIV right now, but I have a long history with Dota 2 and many other games. My list is always evolving and I'm open to playing with other people, so if anyone is looking for somebody to play with feel free to shoot me a message! Beyond gaming and sitting at home, I'm an avid boulderer. Unfortunately, I haven't had many opportunities due to the spreading pandemic, but in my prime I used to be able to climb V4/V5s. I have a feeling that's not the case anymore.

## Your website is down
Yeah.. I'm working on it, I'm so sorry about that! I actually host this website on my Raspberry Pi to give myself some exposure in application hosting. It gave me a good opportunity to play with Docker and learning the ins and outs of ingress/egress network traffic. I'll try my best to get that updated soon, but feel free to look around the source code. If you see something wrong please go ahead and raise an issue! I'd love to fix this and make it better.

## What does ubiquitous-doodle mean?
Absolutely nothing. I wanted something more original than "Website" so I let GitHub generate something for me.
